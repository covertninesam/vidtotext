paused videos get OCR'd into text

## First Steps
- Get Image of Paused Video
	- Create user-defined area to screenshot based on click and drag event.
	- "screenshot" that selected area
- Apply OCR to image
	- Tesseract.js is a possibility
	- Though tenserflow would be more versatile and, of course, more fun/cooler
- Output text from image
	- send straight to user's clipboard and/or create a modal/box with the text broken into different sections based on how it looked on the screen
